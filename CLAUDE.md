# PROJECT_PLAN Integration
# Added by Claude Config Manager Extension

When working on this project, always refer to and maintain the project plan located at `PROJECT_PLAN.md` in the workspace root.

**Instructions for Claude Code:**
1. **Read the project plan first** - Always check `PROJECT_PLAN.md` when starting work to understand the project context, architecture, and current priorities.
2. **Update the project plan regularly** - When making significant changes, discoveries, or completing major features, update the relevant sections in PROJECT_PLAN.md to keep it current.
3. **Use it for context** - Reference the project plan when making architectural decisions, understanding dependencies, or explaining code to ensure consistency with project goals.

**Plan Mode Integration:**
- **When entering plan mode**: Read the current PROJECT_PLAN.md to understand existing context and priorities
- **During plan mode**: Build upon and refine the existing project plan structure
- **When exiting plan mode**: ALWAYS update PROJECT_PLAN.md with your new plan details, replacing or enhancing the relevant sections (Architecture, TODO, Development Workflow, etc.)
- **Plan persistence**: The PROJECT_PLAN.md serves as the permanent repository for all planning work - plan mode should treat it as the single source of truth

This ensures better code quality and maintains project knowledge continuity across different Claude Code sessions and plan mode iterations.
